# 📍 About Me

Hi, I'm **Tamara** — a backend-focused software engineer based in Chicago. 

I specialize in building **scalable REST APIs**, **relational databases**, and **database-driven apps** using technologies like **Node.js**, **PostgreSQL**, **TypeScript**, and **Ruby on Rails**.

I'm passionate about creating clean, maintainable code and building tools that make a real-world impact.

After years as a science educator, I transitioned into software engineering, bringing a mindset of continuous learning, deep problem-solving, and collaboration. I love a good challenge — especially one that ends in a hard-earned debugging victory dance.
