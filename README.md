# 👋 Hi, I'm Tamara

I'm a backend-focused software engineer based in Chicago, specializing in building scalable REST APIs, relational databases, and data-driven applications.

Tech I love working with: **TypeScript**, **Node.js**, **Ruby on Rails**, and **PostgreSQL**.

After years as a science educator, I transitioned into software development, bringing deep problem-solving skills, strong collaboration, and a lifelong love of learning to every project.

Let's build something meaningful — and maybe celebrate with a debugging victory dance along the way! 🎉
